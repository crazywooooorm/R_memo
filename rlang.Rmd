## memo on common rlang functions

### quosure related

```{r}
# -- quo() always keeps the environment where it is run
# base::eval() doesn't trace back, but rlang::eval_tidy() trace to quosure's environment
fn <- function() {
  foobar <- 10
  quo(foobar * 2)
}

quo <- fn()
# -- eval in base
eval(quo)
# -- eval in rlang
rlang::eval_tidy(quo)

```
